# 👋 Hi there, I’m Jessica  

## 🚀 About Me
I’m currently a **Quality Assurance Engineer & contractor for a government health agency** with 4+ years ensuring the accuracy and reliability of HL7-based public-health systems. Leveraging deep QA expertise, I’m now pivoting toward full-time Integration Engineering roles, where I can:

📌 **Actively seeking** Integration Engineer positions to blend my QA rigor with hands-on data-exchange development.

<!---
- Develop and validate HL7 v2.x ↔ FHIR transformations  
- Build and test Mirth Connect channels end-to-end  
- Simulate complex Rhapsody routing logic with JavaScript pipelines  
- Contribute to open-source interoperability tools  





<!--
🔗 HL7 Integration Specialist | FHIR • Rhapsody • Mirth • JavaScript • Public Health Interoperability

Public health-focused Integration Engineer with 4+ years of experience at the CDC modernizing HL7-based systems. I specialize in healthcare data exchange using HL7 v2.x, FHIR, JavaScript, and interface engines like Mirth Connect.

Projects reflect hands-on work with OID registries, FHIR mappings, and real-world HL7 transformations — bridging public health, engineering, and QA. I simulate Rhapsody routing logic through custom JavaScript pipelines and actively build open-source tools for data interoperability.

🔧 Tech Focus:
- HL7 v2.x (ADT, ORU, ORM), FHIR standards
- Mirth Connect (JavaScript transformers, channel design)
- API & EDI integrations, Postman, JSON/XML
- XSLT, Python scripting, SQL automation
- Simulated Rhapsody routing flows in Node.js




<!--
🚀 Featured Projects:
- HL7 → FHIR transformation pipelines
- PHIN-style Admin UI mock
- CCDA to FHIR XSLT mapper
- SMART on FHIR auth client prototype
